## WARNING: HERE BE LAUNDRY-EATING DEMONS!
## I'm currently porting the old Ant build infrastructure to Gradle, and it *does not build* right now.
## End of scheduled announcement.

ReplicatorG is an open-source GCode based controller for RepRap / CNC machines.  It has 3 main goals:

1. Be as simple to use, and as easy to install as possible.
2. Be driver oriented and abstract the GCode away, allowing users to easily create drivers for their own machine.
3. Support as much of the GCode specification as possible.

ReplicatorG was originally abandoned at version 0040 in 2012, since Makerbot had better things to do (cough, cough).
Liam Marshall ([@archimedespi](https://github.com/archimedespi)) created this fork with the intention of modernizing and continuing development.
